Description
Generative AI holds significant transformative potential in medicine, enhancing capabilities across imaging, documentation, education, and decision support. However, its integration faces substantial challenges, including models’ knowledge limitations, the risk of generating incorrect or uncertain “hallucinated” outputs, inherent biases from training data, difficulty in interpreting model reasoning (“black box” nature), and navigating complex regulatory and ethical issues. This review offers a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the promise and the hurdles. While Generative AI is unlikely to fully replace physicians, understanding and leveraging these technologies will be crucial for medical professionals navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.
