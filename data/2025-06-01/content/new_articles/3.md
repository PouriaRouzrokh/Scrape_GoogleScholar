Description
Disclosed herein are computer-implemented methods, and systems for performing such a methods, comprising: obtaining values for one or more non-modifiable risk factors of a patient; obtaining first candidate values for one or more modifiable risk factors of the patient; obtaining second candidate values for the one or more modifiable risk factors of the patient, wherein the second candidate values are determined to maximize the likelihood that the dislocation results from the arthroplasty procedure; determining a personalized risk interval that represents a range of modifiable risk for the patient with respect to the arthroplasty procedure, including determining (i) a lower bound for the personalized risk interval and (ii) an upper bound for the personalized risk interval; and providing an output indicative of the risk interval.
