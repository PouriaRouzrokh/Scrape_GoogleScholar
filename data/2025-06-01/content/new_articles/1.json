They further annotated surgical construct locations in 11,841 knee radiographs. An uncertainty-aware multilabel EfficientNet-based classifier was trained to identify the knee laterality, implants, and radiographic view. A classifier trained with embeddings from the EfficientNet model detected out-of-domain images. An object detection model was trained to identify 20 different knee implants. Model performance was assessed against a held-out internal and an external dataset using per-class F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity \u2026", "num_citations": 2, "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883540324011434", "article_id": "uncertainty-aware-deep-learning-characteriz", "bibtex": "@article{mulford2025uncertainty,\n  author = {Kellen L Mulford and Austin F Grove and Elizabeth S Kaji and Pouria Rouzrokh and Ryan D Roman and Mete Kremers and Hilal Maradit Kremers and Michael J Taunton and Cody C Wyles},\n  title = {Uncertainty-aware deep learning characterization of knee radiographs for large-scale registry creation},\n  journal = {The Journal of Arthroplasty},\n  volume = {40},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {1232-1238},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {Churchill Livingstone},\n  url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883540324011434}\n}"}
