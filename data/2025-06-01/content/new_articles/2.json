However, its integration faces substantial challenges, including models\u2019 knowledge limitations, the risk of generating incorrect or uncertain \u201challucinated\u201d outputs, inherent biases from training data, difficulty in interpreting model reasoning (\u201cblack box\u201d nature), and navigating complex regulatory and ethical issues. This review offers a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the promise and the hurdles. While Generative AI is unlikely to fully replace physicians, understanding and leveraging these technologies will be crucial for medical professionals navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.", "num_citations": 0, "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12178-025-09961-y", "article_id": "a-current-review-of-generative-ai-in-medicine", "bibtex": "@article{rouzrokh2025current,\n  author = {Pouria Rouzrokh and Bardia Khosravi and Shahriar Faghani and Mana Moassefi and M Moein Shariatnia and Parsa Rouzrokh and Bradley Erickson},\n  title = {A Current Review of Generative AI in Medicine: Core Concepts, Applications, and Current Limitations},\n  journal = {Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine},\n  pages = {1-21},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {Springer US},\n  url = {https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12178-025-09961-y}\n}"}
